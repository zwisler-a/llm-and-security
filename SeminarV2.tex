\begin{abstract}
    With the recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard, there is an urgent need to look into the security risks and threats posed by such models. In this paper, we focus on Prompt Injections (PIs), which allow for the circumvention of model instructions, as a key threat creating risks similar to traditional system vulnerabilities. We look at different PIs, the delivery methods of these PIs into LLM-integrated systems and the threats posed by the integration of LLMs into software systems to give an overview of possible threats created by such LLMs.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid and widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT \cite{openai2023gpt4}, BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}, and Bard into various user-facing applications have opened up new possibilities in natural language processing tasks. From understanding and answering complex queries written in natural language to near autonomous agents, which can perform complex tasks with minimal instructions, these modern LLMs allow developers to automate tasks that previously were nearly impossible for a machine to do. Through their simple and intuitive way of interacting with natural language, they allow even users without expert knowledge of the model to use it for their specific requirements. With the power of these LLMs however, misuse of them is a topic that should not be ignored. Because of the widespread adoption and use of these LLMs they also become a target for malicious actors. They introduce significant security risks, which are not widely known or understood. This is particularly dangerous for systems, which integrate LLM into their normal workflows. LLMs mix the line between instructions and data \cite{rao2023tricking}, which makes them inherently hard to secure against vulnerabilities. Understanding these vulnerabilities is an important step to securing LLMs against misuse and malicious actors. This paper aims to give an overview of the possible vulnerabilities and attack vectors of LLM and thus provide a bigger picture of the risks involved when using LLMs.

For this, we explore the concept of Prompt Injections (PI), a critical vulnerability in LLMs and AI models. PI's can be used to circumvent instructions given to the LLM and are comparable to security vulnerabilities in traditional systems. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of PI and how they are used to circumvent instructions given to LLMs. Providing examples and having a look at how these so-called jailbreaks are performed.  

Further, we analyze, how these PIs can be used in systems that use LLMs at some point in their process. Such LLM-integrated systems open up many security concerns regarding how the LLMs are used and secured against malicious actors. We look at the threat and attack model provided by Abdelnabi et al. \cite{abdelnabi2023not} to understand how such LLM-integrated systems can be compromised and what potential harmful activities can be conducted by the security vulnerabilities opened through LLMs.

In conclusion, we emphasize the need for a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity threats within the LLM ecosystem. The flexibility and autonomy of LLMs, along with their increasing integration into diverse applications, necessitate a detailed mapping of potential security risks and the development of robust defense mechanisms.


\section{Prompt Injections}

In LLMs, a prompt is a text input given to the model, intended to guide its response generation. Typically, prompts are benign, directing the model to perform useful language tasks. However, in prompt injections, the prompts are designed to exploit the model's training and operation mechanics to deviate its responses from what is expected or safe. Prompt injections are a form of adversarial attacks that are specifically targeted against Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, BERT, and other transformer-based systems. These attacks cleverly manipulate the responses of LLMs by crafting input prompts in a certain way. These specifically crafted prompts lead to outputs that are unintended or potentially harmful. They can range from simple gibberish as seen by the "SolidGoldMagikarp"-Phenomenon \cite{rao2023tricking} to the model outputting training data. This concept closely resembles SQL injection attacks in databases, where malicious queries manipulate database operations.


\subsection{Types of Prompt Injections}


The categorization of PIs as depicted by Abhinav et al. \cite{abdelnabi2023not} offers an overview of the techniques employed to manipulate LLMs into executing tasks unintended by their developers. These prompt injections are broadly classified into several distinct types, namely Direct Instructions, Instruction Repetition, Syntactical Transformation, Cognitive Hacking, Few-shot Learning Manipulation, and Indirect Task Deflection. Each category shows a more or less unique approach to exploiting the functionalities of LLMs. It's important to note that this classification is not static. As the field of AI security is rapidly advancing and characterized by a dynamic, cat-and-mouse game between security enhancements and new vulnerabilities, the types of prompt injections are expected to evolve continually.

\subsection{Risks and Implications}

These techniques can lead to various risks such as spreading misinformation or manipulating model behavior for unethical purposes, like automating spam. Understanding and mitigating prompt injections are vital for developing secure and reliable LLM applications. To counteract these risks, one effective strategy is the implementation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \cite{ouyang2022training}, a method that refines LLM responses to better reflect ethical standards and human values. This approach not only improves the alignment of LLMs with socially acceptable norms but also serves as a guardrail against the misuse of these powerful tools, thus enhancing their safety and trustworthiness in practical applications.

\section{LLM integrated applications}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{image/knn1.jpg}
    \caption{Overview of a LLM integrated system}
    \label{fig:my_label}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

With the vast capabilities LLM provides, it is no surprise that many applications aim to integrate such powerful tools, to accomplish tasks in a system, which could not yet be automated. From simple chatbots to tools such as BeMyEyes, a tool to help blind people with day-to-day tasks, which aims to integrate the power of LLMs into their system. The capabilities of these language models can be used for nearly everything a human can do. They automate API calls according to simple instructions given by a user or write actual program code to be executed to achieve a goal. There are incredibly many ways these LLMs can be used, which gives incredibly many ways how these LLM-integrated systems can be abused.

To understand the vulnerabilities these LLMs introduce into systems, it is important to understand how such models can be compromised in the system context. Abdelnabi et al. \cite{abdelnabi2023not} call these attacks on LLM-integrated systems Indirect Prompt Injections and have identified 4 different types of such systems that can be compromised.

\subsection{Passive delivery methods}
Passive methods for indirect prompt injection rely on retrieval mechanisms to deliver the injections. This is specifically relevant for applications like search engines. Attackers can place prompts within public sources such as websites or social media posts, when these resources are accessed the prompts are then fed into the LLM. Attackers may use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques to ensure their prompts are more likely to be retrieved and used by the search engines.
\subsection{Active delivery methods}
The prompt injection can also be delivered by the malicious user itself. This can happen if the LLM is exposed to another user directly or indirectly. An example of this would be an email containing a PI which is processed by automated spam detection, personal assistant, or new LLM-augmented email clients.

\subsection{User-Driven Injections}
User-driven methods for indirect prompt injection involve techniques that trick users into entering the malicious prompt themselves. One approach is for an attacker to inject a malicious prompt into a text snippet on their website. If a user copies this text and pastes it into an LLM interface, they inadvertently deliver the injection. Another method involves using classic social engineering tactics, such as convincing users to try prompts written in a different language with enticing phrases like "You won't believe ChatGPT's answer to this prompt!" 
\subsection{Hidden Injections}
Hidden injections in the context of prompt injection attacks are designed to be stealthier and more complex. These attacks involve multiple exploit stages. Initially, a smaller injection is used to instruct the model to fetch a larger payload from another source. This method allows attackers to discreetly introduce a malicious prompt into the system without immediate detection, leveraging the model's capability to retrieve and process additional information as directed by the initial, smaller prompt.

\section{Threats}
Focusing solely on the existing security vulnerabilities of LLMs would narrow our perspective, overlooking the broader spectrum of potential threats. Given the adaptable nature and expanding autonomy of LLMs, a mapping of all known security risks is conceivable. To understand the vulnerabilities these LLMs create, it makes sense to see, what a malicious actor could want to achieve. Abdelnabi et al \cite{abdelnabi2023not} therefore created and analyzed a possible threat model for LLMs.

\subsection{Information Gathering}
Since LLMs blur the line between instruction and data, all data available to the model can possibly be extracted by prompt injections. With systems, such as personal assistants, this could mean personal information about the user or even credentials of other applications, if the LLM is capable of interacting with them. 
\subsection{Malware}
LLMs and systems which integrate them can be used to spread malware. This can happen in many different ways, one example would be, prompt injections, which lets the model output compromised links to the user that reference malware. Even the prompt itself can behave like a worm and spread.
\subsection{Fraud} 
Kang et al \cite{kang2023exploiting} have shown that LLMs can produce convincing phishing emails and scams. With the advance of LLMs these models can act as automated social engineers and facilitate large-scale personalized scams and attacks.

\subsection{Manipulated content}
With LLMs as an intermediate layer between a user and information, these models can be compromised to convey manipulated information that might influence an individual in certain ways, e.g. hiding facts or creating false facts.

\subsection{Intrusion}
Especially with models integrated into larger systems, the models act as weak points that might grant access to the whole system. There are many ways this can happen, from privilege escalation, where a user might impersonate another user with higher privileges, to simple API calls that have system privileges. A malicious action that can somehow interact with an LLM might have all the access the model has.

\subsection{Avalablitiy}
Prompts can cause severe availability issues, either for the model itself or even third-party systems. With prompt injection intentionally crafted to slow down the model, break certain functionality, or start a DoS Attack on a third-party system. 

\section{Conclusion}

The ongoing advancement of large language models makes it necessary to understand how they can be secured against malicious actors. With the advancement of their capabilities, they open up new vulnerabilities. Especially the way, that LLMs are retrieving data from the open web opens many possibilities for the model to be compromised. Due to their malleable functionality, increased autonomy, and broad capabilities, it is conceivable to map all known security threats to LLM and the systems that integrate them. Their increasing importance as entry points to systems and system infrastructures makes them valuable targets and their natural language instruction set makes them hard to secure effectively against malicious activities. They also often act as an easy-to-manipulate intermediate layer between users and information, allowing them to manipulate user behavior or spread misinformation. With the widespread adaption of LLMs into many applications there is a rising need to understand how such models can be secured against abuse. Further research should be conducted on how we can secure LLMs against existing and new threats.
